# Cat Bubbles


Everything started from here:<br>

### My adds:
- counter for points
- after two points, another bubble will be in the game
- the height position of bubbles will change with JS
- possibility to choose player sprite


### Problems:
- the movement is set by Css animation, that has spesific time, <br>
so in smaller screens the bubble movement is much slower
- smaller screens the hitbox is bigger<br><br>

- ---> solution: different approach to the movement in JS or use this<br>
and calculate the movement and hitbox for different screen sizes
